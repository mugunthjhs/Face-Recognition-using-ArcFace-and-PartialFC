# Face Recognition Comparison System

A web-based system to compare face recognition accuracy between ArcFace and Partial FC models. This system allows users to upload two images and compare the similarity scores using both models.

## Features
- Face detection and alignment using RetinaFace
- Support for two face recognition models:
  - ArcFace
  - Partial FC
- Adjustable similarity thresholds
- Web interface for easy comparison
- Docker support for easy deployment

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker (optional)
- 4GB RAM minimum
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, for faster processing)
